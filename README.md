# Movement-of-a-car
This is a C# scripted code including movement for a bike (inspired from car physics formulas) into 2 parts: the 1st one including the basic movement (which is basically done) and the 2nd including the shifting of speeds. 

It isn't for a current use yet, a simulation is in progress where the program is tested.
Wishing to revamp it in JavaScript in order to make it way more accessible for game testing but not yet, scripting it in C# is the main target for now.
(educational purpose only for now)
